<h1>Comic-Web</h1>

<p> 
Comic-web is a <b>markup language</b> for describing comics, as well as a rendering engine for this language.
</p>

<h1>The markup language</h1>

<p> 
The Comic-Web markup language is quite simple, you can understand it in minutes.
</p>

<h2>
Layers
</h2>

Every word that is capitalized and/or followed by an empty line describes a layer in the panel.

<figure>
<img class="panel" src="./comic/02.svg" alt="
THE STUDIO
"></img>
<pre>
THE STUDIO
</pre>
</figure>

<p>
The visualizer searches an image that goes by the name of the layer in the designited folder, only the file names are lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces as separators, (so 'THE STUDIO', becomes 'the-studio.svg'.
</p>

<h2>
Stacking
</h2>

<p>
Each successive layer goes on top of the last one.
</p>

<p>
You can stack as many layers as you want, the only thing is that they should be transparent, else they would just overwrite each other.
</p>


<h2>
Characters
</h2>

<p>
When you have a layer line, followed by some other lines that are not set in all-caps (and have no empty line between them), the engine assumes that the layer is a character, and the lines are... their lines.
</p>

JENCEL

</pre>
</figure>

<p>
If so, the image (named "jencel.svg" in this case) is scalled a bit, so the text panel is visible.
</p>

<h2>
Moods
</h2>

<p>
To help you organize your files better, the engine supports setting "moods" to characters and other images, by enclosing a mood in brackets, next to the character's name. The location where the engine will search for is "<character_name>/<mood>", so, for example the image below is at "./jencel/sad.svg". If the image doesn't exit, it would render "./jencel.svg".
</p>

<figure>
<img class="panel" src="./comic/06.svg" alt="
THE STUDIO

JENCEL (sad)
Oh, where did the cat go?

"></img>
<pre>
THE STUDIO

JENCEL (sad)
Oh, where did the cat go?

</pre>
</figure>

<p>
The moods can also be a comma-separated list, where the logic is the same: "JENCEL (sad, closeup)" would render "./jencel/sad/closeup.svg". If it doesn't find it, it would render "./jencel/sad.svg" and (if that also doesn't exist, just "./jencel.svg").
</p>
 

<p>
You can understand it better if you
<a href="https://github.com/abuseofnotation/comic-web-markup/tree/main/comic">check how the folder of this comic is organized</a>
</p>

 


<h2>
Stacking characters
</h2>

<p>
You can have more than one characters, the engine would do its best to place them and their speech balloons properly.
</p>

Ah, couldn't  you at least
clean this place a bit?

JENCEL
Shhh, it's out of frame.

<p>
When there are more than one character, the engine places the characters and the speech balloons next to each other, according to the way they are defined.
</p>



<h2>
Stacking characters CONTD
</h2>

<p>
You can have many characters on-screen and there isn't any special way to describe characters, any image can be a character.
</p>

<p>
The way that the characters are arranged corresponds to their lines.
</p>

<h2>
Narrators and off-screen dialogue
</h2>

<p>
There is a special 'NARRATOR' character who is always off screen. 
</p>

<p>
And, if you want to have some of the regular characters talking off-screen, there is also a special "off-screen" mood which won't render anything.
</p>

ALYSSA 
So, what are you doing over there?

ALYSSA

<p>
The narrator's lines are always rendered at the top and bottom of the panel, as is customary for comics.
</p>


<h2>
Custom images
</h2>

<p>
If you don't want to use the rendering engine for some panel, you can always paint a whole complete panel and include it.
</p>

<p>
And if you want to draw a custom panel, but still use the speech balloons, you can make use of the "off-screen" mood.
</p>

<h1>The toolchain</h1>
<p>
So, you know about the markup, not let's find out how can we use it.
</p>

<h2>The API</h2>
<p>
The API of Comic Web is exported by <b>lib/index.js</b> and currently it consists of a single JavaScript function, called <b>renderComic</b> accepting a string containing a description of the panel in the format that we described and a directory, where the images are stored. The function returns an SVG DOM element, with the panel. 
</p>

<h2>The plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin is the principal way of using the markup. Basically it consists of the following steps:
</p>
<p>
Include the plugin file in your HTML page.
</p>
<pre>
<script type="module" src="plugin.js"></script>
</pre>

<p>
In the file, insert an image, leading to a non-existent link in your images dir, and put the script in the alt-text property.
</p>
<pre>

<p>
The plugin would generate a panel in the place of the image.
</p>

<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>
This is an interactive environment for writing comics.
<p><a href="editor.html">Try it out</a></p>
</p>

<h2>Styling</h2>
<p>
Besides the images, the engine also embeds a <b>style.css</b> file into all images. This file is used for styling the frames, balloons etc.
